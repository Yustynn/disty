# Disty: Turning people into a Distributed Network of ATMs!

## What's the Problem?
Several developing countries paradoxically have decent mobile data coverage, but really, really few ATMs (e.g. Bangladesh, Egypt, Pakistan). Disty is a sample UI flow for bridging the gap for cash storage and withdrawal.

## Dang. That's Tough! How do we solve it?
See, Disty looks at life as it truly is and sees the duality in human nature: We're not just flesh and blood. We're more than that - we're mobile, roaming, moving, wallets of cold hard cash! So let's turn people into the cash storage and withdrawal facilities for these developing countries. Monetary storage/withdrawal is a such a cornerstone for economic (and everything) growth that it seems ridiculous to even mention it. Let's help these countries be better.

## So what's it look like?
There are slight deviations if you actually run this project (e.g. the TabBar is at the bottom in the actual app), but it's pretty much this.
